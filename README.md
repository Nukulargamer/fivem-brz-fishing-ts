### 

### Highly customisable!

You can change pretty much any aspect of the script, from the fishing mechanics to the UI, everything is customisable.

The script is also 100% unit tested, so you can be sure that your changes won't break anything, it also makes the script easy read, understand and maintain by you or other contributors.

### Integration with other frameworks

The script is designed to be framework agnostic, but it has built-in support for qb-core and Quasar Framework (qs-inventory). Integrating with other frameworks is easy, given the script's modular architecture.

## Installing
